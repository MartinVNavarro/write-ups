# Methodology

Brief explanation of your overall approach and any particular methodologies you followed (such as PTES, OWASP, etc.)

# Reconnaissance

Detail the tools (like Nmap) and techniques you used to gather information about the system.

## Initial Scan

Details of your initial scan results.

## Version Analysis

Any interesting findings based on version numbers of the systems or software.

# Foothold and Pivots

Explain how you gained each foothold and performed pivots, in the order they occurred. If there were multiple footholds and pivots, use sub-sections for each one.

## Foothold 1

- **Description**: Details of the initial foothold.
- **Proof of Concept**: Steps you took to gain this foothold.

## Pivot 1

- **Description**: Details of the first pivot.
- **Proof of Concept**: Steps you took to make the pivot.

Repeat for each foothold and pivot.

# Exploitation

Explain the exploitation process for the vulnerabilities discovered after each pivot. 

## Exploit 1

- **Description**: Detail of the exploit.
- **Proof of Concept**: Steps you took to exploit the vulnerability.

Repeat for each exploit.

# Privilege Escalation

Explain how you escalated your privileges (if applicable).

## Method

Detail of the technique(s) used for privilege escalation.

# Lessons Learned

What did you learn from this challenge? This could include both things that helped you solve it, as well as things that didn't work out but still provided a valuable learning experience.
